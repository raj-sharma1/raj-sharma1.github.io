<div class ="articletitle">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</div>

<p>HTML is the structure (content) and CSS is the design (layout). 
HTML is like the structure of the house and CSS represent colours, design and styles to your house.</p>

<div class ="articletitle">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</div>

<p>Control flow is how the program runs and jumps from one section to another when the instruction or statement or functions are executed.</p>
<p> Loops allow you to iterate over collections and objects. They allow you to execute the same code block again and again until a certain condition is met.</p>
<p>The best example I can think of is like playing a video game, some of the games that we play comprises of level 1, level 2 and so on. To reach level 2 we have to meet the condition of finishing level 1, once we finish level 1 it adds up and take us to the level 2 and the level keeps increasing until we come to end of the game.</p>


<div class ="articletitle">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</div>

<p>DOM is an acronym for Document object Model.   It defines the logical structure of document and the way a document is accessed or interact and manipulated on a webpage.</p>
<p>It represents the html document which comprises of elements; every element in the dom, including the text and attributes are considered nodes.</p> 
<p>DOM basically connects your scripting language to the Document (webpage). </p>
<p>When you create a script–whether it's inline in a script element or included in the web page by means of a script loading instruction–you can immediately begin using the API for the document or window elements to manipulate the document itself or to get at the children of that document, which are the various elements in the web page.</p>

<div class ="articletitle">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</div>

<p>Array is used when order is the most important factor for organizing the information whereas objects are best when you want to organize based on data labels. The other difference is array access number index to call on its data[0] while object would need to know the name associated to call upon normally a string describing a data. You can access object properties in two ways </p>

<p>eg:- 
var person = {
  firstName: "Raj",
  lastName: "Sharma",
  age: 31,
};
person.firstName;
person[‘firstName’];
</p>

<div class ="articletitle">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</div>

<p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. The benefit of using function is you can define the code once and use it many times. You can use the same code many time with different arguments, to produce different results.</p>

<p>eg:- function myFunction () {
alert(“Hello World”);
}
myfunction();
</p>
