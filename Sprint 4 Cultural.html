     <div class ="articletitle"> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</div>
     
     <p>Neuroplasticity talks about that the brain is malleable and it can grow your minds and ability to achieve things in life which the people thought wasn’t possible before. Below are the few points to take advantage of Neuroplasticity to benefit in your life.</p>
     
     <ol>
     <p><li>Having a positive mental attitude and imagination helps to grow your mind tremendously. The power of positive thoughts and imagination plays an important part in Neuroplasticity.</li></p>
     <p><li>Challenging self with a difficult task and having a positive affirmation of ‘I can do it’ will go a long way than thinking about its too difficult and ‘I can’t do it’</li></p>
     <p><li>Practice on a regular basis, working really hard and keeping the above two points in mind can build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connection in the brain.</li></p>
     <p><li>Linking to what you have studied with your day to day lives will help you to remember things and concepts.</li></p>
     </ol>
     
     <div class ="articletitle">Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</div>
     
     <p>The first and foremost thing that I will be focusing on is keeping a positive thoughts and imagination. Reminding myself with positive affirmation whenever I feel it’s too difficult or I can’t do it. Enjoying the current process of studying and learning rather than thinking it’s too much to study and I am not sure whether I will be able to finish it before the end of this sprint. Practice, practice and practice and enjoying this process.</p>
     
     <div class ="articletitle">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</div>
     <ol>
     <p><li>By challenging your mind with a difficult task and being persistent and positive about it.</li></p>
     <p><li>This is the most important one, Practice regularly and focusing on small achievement.</li></p>
     <p><li>Changing your bad habits or acquiring a new habit that you want can increase neuroplasticity</li></p>
     </ol>

     <div class ="articletitle">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</div>
     <p>Growth mindset is the ability to grow your mind by efforts and hard work. Carol Dweck talks about Growth and Fixed mindset people and the main distinguish between them is growth mindset people focus on process whereas fixed mindset people think they can’t change their life and believe if they work hard or put more effort they will come across stupid and dumb.  Growth mindset people engage deeply in their work and if they come across any hurdle they won’t put themselves down instead will work harder to solve it.</p>
     <p>The relevance of growth mindset is its helps people to have a positive perspective of life in general. Thinking in terms of growth mindset will help to achieve more in life and more importantly be happy and can become successful whatever they desire.</p>
     
     
     <div class ="articletitle">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</div>
     <p>Yes, one of the aspect that surprise me was about the ‘Yet’ and ‘Not Yet’. Doing any work or task and focusing more on the process and thinking in terms of Yet and Not Yet will help to grow your mind and finish any challenging task with ease. </p>
     
     <div class ="articletitle">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</div>
     <p>I will try to be consciously aware and will focus more on the process of Yet and Not Yet. Having positive mental thoughts, working hard, practicing regularly and focusing more on a journey of continual improvement.</p>

     <div class ="articletitle">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</div>
     <p>I have really enjoyed this session and have understood the importance of how to grow your mind by having positive imagination and affirmation of I can do it and simultaneously putting more efforts on my work.  Understanding about Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset will help me a lot in my learning plan. Focusing more on the process and thinking in terms of Yet and Not yet will help me to clear hurdles that I will come across in future. </p>
