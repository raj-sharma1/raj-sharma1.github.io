<div class ="articletitle">A description of your own strengths and limitations</div>

                <p>My strength is if I set my mind onto something I work very hard and achieve it. I am an optimistic person and if I like what I am doing I become very driven and focused. I consider myself a very curious person and I asked lot of question, this strength of mine will really help me in my learning goal.
                My limitation is my attention span is very low and I keep wandering suddenly into something else. Keeping focus in one aspect I find really hard to concentrate.</p> 
                
                <div class ="articletitle">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</div>
                <p>Well, I am following 30 to 40 hours of week studying sometime its higher. Since last 3 week I have started studying I have notice my best time to focus and study properly is in the morning so to be more productive I will focus on learning important articles and concept in the morning and practicing it in the afternoon time as of now.  
                Also I will try to keep my learning plan as per the timebox so I don’t spend too much of a time on particular topic. 
                I will submit the assessment every week before Sunday and if in case I am not able to submit it before the given deadline I will let my facilitator know with the appropriate reason.</p>
                
                
                <div class ="articletitle">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</div>
                <p>This is one of the areas that I have to work on; when I am getting stuck i spend a lot of time to find out the solution on my own, moving forward if I am stuck for 2 hours in a particular topic I will ask for help from my facilitators, classmate or slack desk.</p>
                	
                <div class ="articletitle">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</div>
                <p>Well at the current stage my expectation have been met so I don’t really expect anything from the facilitation team, Chris have been very helpful and approachable so that’s become easy for me. I can discuss my doubt without thinking twice and he listens to me and offers great solution and if I don’t understand anything he again communicate with a simple explanations. I strongly believe and have experienced myself, if your teacher is really good it help student to grow and become great at anything they set their mind to it.</p>
