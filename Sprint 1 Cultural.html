                <div class ="articletitle">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</div>
                   
               <p>My core values are forgiveness and honesty. I am a firm believer of forgiveness. I believe in today’s world it is very essential to free yourself from pain and agony that clinging on to past holds. I also truly believe that honesty to oneself and others takes us on the right path of self-growth, inner peace and prosperity.
                    I consider myself a very modest person holding strong ethical beliefs like fairness, equality and kindness to others. I like to keep myself unattached to the materialistic and monetary perks of life and believe in living my life to fullest by fulfilling my purpose of life without mistreating any living creature alive. 
                    For instance during my last job I came across a strong prospective client who can come onboard with my company bringing immense business to the company considerably increasing its cash flow earning me handful commission but during our discussion I realized that he might join hands with the company but it isn’t very fruitful to his business. He seemed to be very content with business plus he is tight in cash and if he joins hands it might severely impact his cash flow. After the meeting and fulfilling my duties of explaining every benefit he asked me my suggestion and I gave a very honest answer telling him that it wasn’t the right time to join us and he could join when is ready to expand the business.
                    He was very affirmative and proud of my suggestion and promised to reach me soon with new ideas regarding  expansion where we can be mutually increase our companies cash flow. My honesty earned me good rewards and a very good friend.</p>
                    
                    <div class ="articletitle">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</div>
                    <p>It has a huge impact on my very existence. I am born and brought up in India which is a land of high spiritual values teaching us very well our moral duties of life explaining us principles of karma which inculcates the qualities of honesty, simplicity, kindness and most of all integrity in me. My mind is designed my default rules of the right principles and beliefs which have been taught to me since my childhood by my parents and a very wholesome society.</p>
                    
                    <div class ="articletitle">Describe your strengths and limitations.</div>
                    
                    <strong class="make">Strength</strong>

                    <p><strong>Optimism-</strong>
                    I usually convinced to see brighter side of things and maintaining a positive outlook.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Curiosity-</strong> 
                        I ask a lot of questions to oneself and others. I spend my most of the time exploring new documentaries or books or real nature.</p>
                    
                     <p><strong>Determination-</strong>My determination comes from my priorities. If I focus on something, I desperately seek it and I am at peace only after achieving it.</p>

        
                    <strong class="make">Limitation</strong>
                    
                    <p><strong>Focus-</strong> My mind is most of the times full of thoughts hence lack attention span.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Status Quo-</strong> Going into a comfort zone.</p>
                    
                  
                  
                    <div class ="articletitle">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</div>
                    
                    <p>My strength is if I set my mind onto sometime I try very hard and achieve it. i am an optimistic person and if I like what I am doing I become very driven and focused. My limitation is my attention span is very low and I keep wandering suddenly into something else. Keeping focus in one aspect I find really hard to concentrate.</p>
                    
                    <div class ="articletitle">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</div>
                    
                    <p>Give me an honest, but not unduly critical or judgemental, feedback will help me in my learning journey.</p>
                   
                     <p>Being optimistic on what I am learning and I am able to understand and implement what I have studied will help me to learn in my learning journey.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Curiosity-
                     Always hunting for a richer learning environment - the process keeps me energized.</p> 
                    
                     <p>Learn by teaching others –
                     I like joining myself in fruitful conversations and believe in learning from each conversation.</p>

                    <div class ="articletitle">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</div>
                    
                    <p>My teammates had friction with one of our colleague in our team in my previous company, the environment became very tensed no one felt like coming to office and we were trying to get a deal sorted with one of our client and it was affecting our productivity. 
                    We decided to discuss the issue with her we talked our concern about her behavior and gave her a chance to exchange the same. We realized the mistake was from both ends and after sorting the issue. We started working on our project together building trust in each other again. 
                    One of the things that worked in the above scenario was clearly communicating the differences and being aware of each other feeling and responsible for the outcome. 
                    One of the strategies that I would try is building trust in each other and having regular open ended conversations regularly to try and work out issues. This will help to reduce clashes and bring wholesome environment growth and enhance our productivity building excitement in the team.
                    Cultivating open communication by encouraging people to speak, share ideas, make suggestion and voice their opinions. Communication is a two-way street and people should feel like they can add to the conversation with anyone.</p>
