    <div class ="articletitle">Got blocked on a simple problem</div>
      <p>
        I had an awful time with kata from looking and trying to find the meaning and researching concepts and implementing on the challenge. From a small and simple mistake like the use of curly braces, brackets and semi colon. It’s mostly a frustration about knowing what i want the code to do and finding it difficult how to write the code. After practicing and going through all the other kata i somewhat gain confidence how to go about it but i do need lot of practice to become good at it.
      </p>

      
    <div class ="articletitle">Solved a problem in an elegant way</div>
      <p>
        I wouldn’t say i solved it in an elegant way but it was somewhat easy for me solve the manipulating javascript object as compare to other kata challenges
      </p>

      <div class ="articletitle">Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</div>

      <p>
        <strong>Pseudocode-</strong> I like this process and it do make the job simpler and efficient. Not yet confident and i would require a lot of practice on this for sure.
      </p>  
      
      <p>
        <strong>Trying something-</strong> I have been looking at other example on stackoverflow to understand how they have done it and i try to practice it simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Rubber ducky method-</strong> I have done this with my friends explaining them the problem that I am facing in javascript and when i explain them i have been able to figure out the solution.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Reading error messages-</strong> Reading the error messages helps me a lot with cleaning up my javascript and code.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Console.logging-</strong> it’s a great way to check if you’re coding works so this is very useful.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Googling-</strong> this is my first go to solution to any problem
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Asking your peers for help-</strong> I am comfortable asking for help from my peers if i am stuck, only once i am comfortable with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Asking coaches for help-</strong> I have been very honest with my coaches and will tell them exactly how I feel about it so they can help me.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection-</strong> this is really helping me i am reflecting regularly to see where I am making a mistake and how do i improve it.
