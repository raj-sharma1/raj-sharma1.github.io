               <div class ="articletitle">What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</div>

               <p> The easiest way to understand is to know the basic concept of box model in design. Box model is a box that wraps around HTML elements and includes the following terms margins, border, padding and content.
                   
                    <p><strong>Content:-</strong> this is where the text and images appear.</p>

                    <p><strong>Padding:- </strong> the space between the content and border is known as padding. Adding padding will add space around the content or element.</p>
                    
                     <p><strong>Border:-</strong>  is the outer side of your whole element or a border that goes around the padding and content.</p> 
                    
                    <p><strong>Margin:- </strong> clears an area outside the border, its gives space between two elements this is a great option to apply when you donâ€™t want your element to be congested. Margin is also transparent.
