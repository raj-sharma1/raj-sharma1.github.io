    <div class ="articletitle"> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</div>

       <p> 
      <strong>Motivation-</strong> My motivation was always based on the external reward and once I achieved it i used to become very complacent, I have to find internal motivation so that I won’t be self-satisfied once I have achieved my goal.
       </p>

       <p>
        <strong>Self-regulation-</strong> I should think before I speak, I am very respectable to people but after going through this, it dawns on me that sometime I do say things without thinking.
       </p> 

       <p>
        <strong>Social Skills-</strong> I enjoying being alone, I don’t like to meet many people I rather spend some time alone than meeting new people. I was never liked this I used to be an extrovert person who used to meet people and make new friends, I didn’t know how this transformation happened but would like to change this aspect of my life.
       </p> 


      <div class ="articletitle"> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</div>

       <p>
        <strong> Neuroplasticity-</strong> I really enjoyed this session and was surprised by this.  I knew that if you practice a lot you can become good at it but never came across any scientific study which can prove this.
       </p>

      <div class ="articletitle"> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</div>
       <p>
        The most challenging was finding out the identity and value exploration. It took me a lot of time to think about what my values are, I have never taught so deeply onto this aspect so it was bit of a struggle for me.
       </p> 

      <div class ="articletitle"> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</div>
        <p>
          Core learning has really helped me to finish the foundation course, it does teach us about our mindset and how should we go about it to practice any new skills. I would say Core learning was the most important part in our learning journey of web development and now i understood why Dev Academy focused on core learning.
        </p>

      <div class ="articletitle">	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer</div>
        <p>
          No it didn’t felt like a waste of time at all. As I said earlier this have really helped me to understand about myself and how to finish the foundation without taking too much of stress. I have learned a lot of things which I wasn’t aware of such as neuroplasticity, some part of emotional intelligence and finding my values and identity.
